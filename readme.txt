Coal Fields of the Conterminous United States: National Coal Resource Assessment Updated Version


By Joseph A. East

U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2012-1205



The GIS files from the 2013 Coal fields of the conterminous United States: National Coal 
Resource Assessment updated version include a collection of shapefiles from four NCRA 
reports that were published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and one report that 
was published by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The GIS ArcMap project 
is designed to be a complement to the published map sheet and to allow the user to examine 
detailed shapefiles and their associated data in the tables. The project does not recreate 
the original assessment GIS projects, but selectively includes the NCRA isopach and 
overburden shapefiles for the coal beds and zones, as well as new GIS data created for 
this publication, and allows the user to examine data from all five major coal regions in one project.


The new data that have been created consist of:


Coal Field Point Locations –point shapefile that shows the generalized location of a 
coal field or area and serves the function as a label for a related polygon


EIA_Coal_Production –polygon shapefile containing individual annual State coal 
production information


Coal Provinces – polygon shapefile displaying coal provinces


Existing GIS data that have been updated in this publication include:
NCRA Assessed Basins – polygon shapefile displaying all areas that were assessed 
in the NCRA Coal Fields – polygon shapefile displaying rank of coal from the rank 
attribute of the Coal_Fields
shapefile


Age of Coal Fields – polygon shapefile displaying rank of coal from the age 
attribute of the Coal_Fields shapefile


Unassessed Mesozoic Basins – polygon shapefile displaying eastern Mesozoic 
basins that have not been quanitatively assessed by the USGS for coal resources, 
but potentially may contain coal.



To access information on any of these datasets, the reader should examine the 
tables for each shapefile or use the identify function located in the ArcMap toolbox.

Information for each NCRA assessment area can be accessed by expanding the layers for 
the Appalachian Basin, Gulf Coast, Illinois Basin, Northern Rocky Mountains and 
Great Plains, and Colorado Plateau, and zooming the view into the appropriate shapefiles.
