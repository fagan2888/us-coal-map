  Description:
    Abstract:
      As part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Coal
      Assessment Program for the Illinois Basin, the Illinois,
      Indiana, and Kentucky Geological Surveys each produced
      statewide thickness maps for the Springfield coal. To
      better provide a regional view of trends in this coal bed,
      the three individual files were merged together into a
      single basin-wide coverage.
    Purpose:
      Coal thickness maps are fundamental to coal resource
      analysis. Regional views assist planners and policy-makers
      in their tasks.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Completeness_Report:
    Polygon files from the three states were converted to
    raster grids with 200-meter cell sizes. The individual
    grids were merged, then smoothed with a majorityfilter
    function, then converted back to vector polygon format. The
    most generalized attributes from the three states were used
    to ensure uniformity within the regional view.

        provided component state-wide files used for compilation of
        basin-wide coverages.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        (1) Component vector files were converted to 200-meter
        raster grids. (2) Grids were reclassified to consistent
        attribute scheme. (3) Grids were merged into one large
        grid, using the Arc "Merge" command. (4) Gaps along state
        boundaries were filled with the Arc "EuclidianAllocation"
        algorithm. (5) The Arc "Majority Filter" algorithm was run
        to remove speckles, and reduce sharp angles. (6) The final
        grid was converted back to vector polygon format. (7) A
        legend field was added to the attributes to supplement the
        grid codes.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Areas defined as "no coal" or "Insufficient Data" are
      where the *position* of the coals is identifiable using the
      surrounding stratigraphy, but there is no coal preserved in
      the rock record.  They are areas within the outcrop extent
      of the coal beds where we have data essentially
      demonstrating zero coal thickness.  In addition, given that
      these regional datasets are a compilation of data
      generated by each of the three states (Kentucky, Illinois,
      Indiana) within the Illinois basin, some discrepencies
      between states may exist. For instance, "Channels" have
      been defined and are represented in Illinois and Kentucky
      but have been extracted out of the coal extent in Indiana.
      In addition, some features have been defined as
      "Unassessed."  These are areas which exist within the
      coal extent but have not been assessed and have
      no value.
