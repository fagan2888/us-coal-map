<abstract>
This dataset is a polygon shapefile representing the most recent
update of the Coal Fields of the Conterminous United States (Tully,
1996). Scale of data is 1:5,000,000. This shapefile is based on
the areas that were quantitatively assessed by the USGS as part of
the National Coal Resource Assessment (NCRA). The outlines contain
areas from which data was collected and processed in order to give an
accurate estimation of the volume of coal in specific targeted beds
and zones. The data used to create this shapefile was collected from
the 4 NCRA regional assessment files produced by the USGS and from
AAPG Discovery Series 14/Studies in Geology 62, all of which were
conducted by USGS geologists and professional staff.
</abstract>
<purpose>
This dataset was compiled to update the Coal Fields Map of the
Conterminous United States, OFR 96-092. This was done with new data
provided by the USGS Energy Team NCRA assessments. The shapefile
gives a visual display of the areas that were assessed by the NCRA.

<logic>Map elements were visually checked for overshoots, undershoots, duplicates, polygon closure and proper attribution. All polygons were created from existing shapefiles or coverages that had already gone through the USGS publications process.</logic>
<complete>Data set complete. No data were intentionally omitted from the hard copy and digital source maps.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>The shapefile is based on data taken from the 4 USGS Professional Papers 1625-A, 1625-B, 1625-C, and 1625-D, and from AAPG Discovery Series 14/Studies in Geology 62. The assessment shapefiles and coverages were merged into the primary shapefile with no change in projection or transformation of a datum, so it is assumed that they are still within the tolerances necessary for FGDC standards. The shapefiles available in U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1625-C are generalized versions of the ArcINFO coverages and are not as detailed as the coverages. The coverages were used for the Appalachian data set within this primary shapefile.</horizpar>

<procstep>
<procdesc>The NCRA Assessed Basins shapefile is a merge of multiple shapefiles and coverages taken from the NCRA Assessment files. Individual assessment areas were modified to delete differing attributes. The outlines were then pasted into a primary shapefile. An attribute column for Province was added to the primary shapefile. The shapefile was then placed on top of the province polygon, and was then attributed to match the provinces. All of the shapefiles were stored in a geographic NAD1983 projection, so there was no need to reproject or do a datum transformation.</procdesc>
